Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a text analysis technique that categorizes data by aspect and identifies the sentiment attributed to each one. Aspect-based sentiment analysis can be used to analyze customer feedback by associating specific sentiments with different aspects of a product or service.

When we talk about aspects, we mean the attributes or components of a product or service e.g. “the user experience of a new product,” “the response time for a query or complaint,” or “the ease of integration of new software.”

Sentiments: positive or negative opinions about a particular aspect
Aspects: the category, feature, or topic that is being talked about
